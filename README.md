Assembly Code Leakage Detection tool

This AVR simulator is a tool that can
detect several types of leakages by analysing an assembly code.
The main ideas are presented in the paper that was presented at 
COSADE (Workshop on Constructive Side-Channel Analysis and Secure Design) in 2017
at Paris, France (Telecom ParisTech).
